<h3>PROJECT</h3>

<ul>
<h4>Over Voltage and Under Voltage Protection of The System </h4>
  <li>I developed the low voltage and high voltage tripping mechanism to protect the load from the damage. Through this project we can safely guard the home appliance without damaging the equipment.</li>
  <h4><h4>Over Voltage and Under Voltage Protection of The System </h4></h4>
  <li>I designed the circuit in such a manner that whenever any outside persons enter the home it gives signals. </li>
  <h4>Energy Management in Smart Cities </h4>
  <li>The circuit automatically switch offs the lights during the day condition and switch on the lights only in dark conditions</li>
  <h4>Power factor Penalty Minimization using APFC unit</h4>
  <li>I designed the circuit in such a way that whenever power factor reduces it adds the capacitor to the circuit and the power factor maintenance constant to avoid penalty</li>
